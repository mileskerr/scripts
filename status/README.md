scripts for dwm status bar

these are all run by dwmblocks

anything that uses a progress bar is only gonna work with the dwm-statuscolors patch

the progressbars are made out of highlight colors. by default they use the 2nd colorscheme as normal fg, 4th colorscheme as green fg, 6th colorscheme as red fg, and 3rd colorscheme as bg.
